# peeeew-topoflow
Topology flowchart ("network weathermap"), with live values, drawn by JavaScript and SVG with your web browser. Relies on JSON files to feed topology/data.

**Disclaimer: This is not production ready in any way, we're still adding basic stuff and basicly making it work as intended.**

## Dependancies
PS: No need to install anything :-)
* Relies on D3 javascript library - https://d3js.org/. This is being loaded from the d3js CDN.
* Will soon utilize the excellent graphics from the ecceman's affinity repo for network graphics - https://github.com/ecceman/affinity. The vector images we want to use will be included in the javascript directly (drawn by D3 into the SVG object).
* Relies (... barely) on jQuery. This is being loaded from the jQuery CDN. Dependancy will probably be removed later on.


# Why?
* áº€hen you need something to quick draw a topology flow map.
* When you need something lighter than php-weathermap for network weathermaps.
* When you do not want to run anything serverside.
* When you need something to update constantly, like once a second.

# Script library
We will share some scripts here to generate JSON data files for topoflow. Feel free to modify them to your own liking. Most of them will probably be written in Python3.


# Todo (somewhat in prioritized order)
1. Optimization - only define things once
2. Making the terms less network specific, as topoflow could be used to other things than network topologies
3. Write documentation for all the possible values to use in a JSON file
4. Figure out how to use the Ecceman stencils for symbols, and include some of them in Topoflow.
5. Window scaling - e.g. making the SVG full screen regardless of aspect ratio
6. Max in, max out. Define colors, define thresholds

# Format/options


## links
### Example
```
"links": [
    {
        "from": "00a-core-1",
        "to": "00b-core-1",
        "rate_out": "1",
        "rate_in": "10"
    },
    {
        ...
    }
]
```

### Definitions
* `type`
  * Defines if a link is unidirectional or bidirectional
  * 1way
  * 2way (default)
* `state`
  * Defines if the link is up or down
  * up (default)
  * down
* `from` (required)
  * Name of the "from" node
* `to` (required)
  * Name of the "to" node
* `rate` (only applicable to type: 1way)
  * Defines the current rate of the link. Shown as overlay on the drawn link. Free text.
* `rate_in` (only applicable to type: 2way)
  * Defines the current inbound rate of the link. Shown as overlay on the drawn link. Free text.
* `rate_out` (only applicable to type: 2way)
  * Defines the current outbound rate of the link. Shown as overlay on the drawn link. Free text.
* `load` (only applicable to type: 1way)
  * Defines the current load on the unidirectional link.
    * Only accepts int from 0 to 100.
    * Colors are customizable through `options -> colors -> load_colors` []
* `load_in` (only applicable to type: 2way)
  * Defines the current inbound load on the bidirectional link.
    * Only accepts int from 0 to 100.
    * Colors are customizable through `options -> colors -> load_colors` []
* `load_out` (only applicable to type: 2way)
  * Defines the current outbound load on the bidirectional link.
    * Only accepts int from 0 to 100.
    * Colors are customizable through `options -> colors -> load_colors` []

## nodes
### Example
```
"nodes": {
    "node1": {
        "x": 100,
        "y": 100,
        "text_position" : "top"
    },
    "node2": {
        "x": 500,
        "y": 400
    }
}
```

### Definitions
* `x` (required)
  * The x axis position, in points
* `y` (required)
  * The y axis position, in points
* `text_position`
  * Where should the text of the node name be placed in relation to the node?
  * center
